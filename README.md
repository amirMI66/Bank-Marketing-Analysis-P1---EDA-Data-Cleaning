# Bank-Marketing-Analysis-P1---EDA-Data-Cleaning
We will be using a real world bank marketing dataset. The dataset contains
information about customers who were contacted as part of a telephone marketing
campaign trying to get customers to sign up for a term deposit product. The
dataset also contains information about whether the customer has been contacted
as part of the current marketing campaign or had been as part of a previous
campaign.
